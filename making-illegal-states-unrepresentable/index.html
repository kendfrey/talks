# Making Illegal States Unrepresentable

## How dependent types make bugs impossible

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

I want to introduce various kinds of types that can be used in programming.

- Simple types
- Generic types
- Generalized algebraic data types
- Dependent types
- Propositions

C# only supports the first two, but let's make up some syntax to pretend it supports the rest.

[Lean](https://lean-lang.org/about/) is a functional programming language that supports all of these.
I'll use it to provide real working code.

---

# Prologue: Why Types?

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

Types serve two major purposes:

- Abstraction - humans need to understand code.
- Static code analysis - computers need to understand code, too.

--

## Abstraction

Types let us make code "about" useful concepts like dates, users, and files.
We're no longer restricted to thinking about a single kind of data, such as bytes.

Types define which values and operations are valid in a given context.
We can write code "about" sending an email or cropping an image, but cropping an email is not a valid concept.

To borrow a phrase coined by Yaron Minsky, we can use types to
[make illegal states unrepresentable](https://blog.janestreet.com/effective-ml-revisited/).

The simplest example is a yes/no flag.
When everything is made of bytes, there are 256 possible states, but we only want there to be two (yes and no).
There will be at least 254 illegal or redundant states.

A boolean type solves this problem by having only two possible states, by definition.

This approach is fantastically useful in making code more robust without needing to write a lot of error checking.
The definitions of types can limit the kinds of mistakes that can be made.

--

## Static analysis

The most directly useful way to use types is to allow the compiler to check code for certain kinds of errors.

```cs
DateTime MyFunction(int a, string b)
{
    return a / b;
}
```

This code is syntactically correct, but obvious nonsense.
You can't divide a number by a string, especially not in a way that produces a date/time.

Understanding what went wrong requires knowing about types.
Once we have a compiler that knows about types,
it can check code automatically to stop us when we make that kind of mistake.

--

## Example 1

```cs
var a = Console.ReadLine();
var b = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine($"Sum: {a + b}");
```

If you make this mistake, you're not going to notice until you test it, and learn that the sum of 1 and 2 is 12.

If you had used the correct types here, the compiler would have forced you to fix it:

```cs
int a = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int b = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine($"Sum: {a + b}");
```

--

## Example 2

```cs
int Randomize(int input)
{
	List<int> list = new List<int>() { 1, 9, 3, 6, 0, 2, 7, 8, 5, 4 };
	return list[input];
}
```

No bonus points for figuring out how to break this.
It's easy to see that if you pass in anything larger than 9, this is going to throw an exception.

It would be nice to have the compiler also prevent this and only allow inputs within the valid range.
Unfortunately it's a bit difficult in C#, but by the end I'll show how it can be done in a language with dependent types.

--

## Example 3

```cs
int Randomize(int input)
{
	List<int> list = new List<int>() { 1, 9, 3, 6, 0, 2, 7, 8, 5, 4 };
	return list.BinarySearch(input);
}
```

This one is a bit more insidious.
`BinarySearch` is supposed to return the index of the item in the list, or a negative number if it's not found.
1 is the first item in the list, but `list.BinarySearch(1)` returns -6.
Most of the numbers 0-9 will fail similarly, even though they're all in the list.
Some of them will work though, with no clear pattern.

What you forgot is that `BinarySearch` requires the list to be sorted.
If you pass it garbage in, you get garbage out.

This type of error can also be prevented at compile time with dependent types, as you'll see later.

---

# Chapter 1: Simple types

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

We can start with some basic types:

- `int`
- `string`
- `bool`
- `Type`

Lean has them too, just with uppercase names: `Int`, `String`, `Bool`, and `Type`.

We can also combine primitive types to represent more complex objects.

--

## Records

A record combines multiple pieces of data into a single value.
In C# there are a few ways to build records, but the most common is with a class.

A record type is built by composing other types, like `string` and `int`.

```cs
class Person
{
	public string Name;
	public int Age;
}
```

In Lean, it looks like this:

```hs
structure Person :=
(name : String)
(age : Int)
```

--

## Functions

A function is a machine that takes some input and produces some output.

We can build a function type by specifying the input and output types.

```cs
delegate string PersonSerializer(Person person);
```

In Lean:

```hs
def PersonSerializer := Person → String
```

--

## Unions

A union allows several different types of values, but can only hold one at a time.

C# doesn't have union types per se, but we can use something like this to get close:

```cs
class FlexibleID
{
	public int ID;
	public string NaturalKey;
	public bool IsID => NaturalKey == null;

	public ID(int id) => ID = id;
	public ID(string naturalKey) => NaturalKey = naturalKey;
}
```

In Lean, the `⊕` operator defines a union type.

```hs
def FlexibleID := Int ⊕ String
```

--

## Enums

An enum is a type that can hold one of a fixed set of values.

```cs
enum Bool
{
	True,
	False,
}
```

In Lean, enums are defined by using inductive types.

```hs
inductive Bool
| true
| false
```

--

## Inductive types

An inductive type is kind of like a enum, but where each value can hold additional data.

If C# had inductive types, they might look something like this:

```cs
inductive FlexibleID
{
	FromID(int id),
	FromNaturalKey(string naturalKey),
}
```

In Lean:

```hs
inductive FlexibleID
| fromID (id : Int)
| fromNaturalKey (naturalKey : String)
```

--

Inductive types are extremely powerful, and most of the previous ideas are really different kinds of inductive types.

In fact, since inductive types can be recursive, you don't need primitive types like numbers and arrays.
They can be built from scratch.

Let's build the natural numbers (nonnegative integers):

```cs
inductive Nat
{
	Zero,
	OnePlus(Nat n),
}
```

```hs
inductive Nat
| zero
| onePlus (n : Nat)
```

--

How about lists?

```cs
inductive ListOfNats
{
	Empty,
	Add(Nat head, ListOfNats tail),
}
```

```hs
inductive ListOfNats
| empty
| add (head : Nat) (tail : ListOfNats)
```

---

# Chapter 2: Generic types

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

There's a problem with the simple type system we've seen so far.
We defined a type that can represent a list of numbers, but what if we want a list of strings, or a list of booleans?
It wouldn't be good to repeat the same basic definition over and over for each possible type.

Generic types solve this problem.
They let us pass types as parameters, so we can create a version of the generic type for any type we wish.

--

## Records

Records can be generic:

```cs
class Vector2D<T>
{
	public T X;
	public T Y;
}
```

```hs
structure Vector2D (α) :=
(x : α)
(y : α)
```

--

## Functions

Functions can be generic, too:

```cs
delegate string Serializer<T>(T value);
```

```hs
def Serializer (α) := α → String
```

--

## Inductive types

Inductive types too:

```cs
inductive List<T>
{
	Empty,
	Add(T head, List<T> tail),
}
```

```hs
inductive List (α)
| empty
| add (head : α) (tail : List α)
```

---

# Chapter 3: Generalized algebraic data types

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

Let's briefly look at generalized algebraic data types, or GADTs for short.
GADTs are generic inductive types where different constructors return different types.

Let's imagine we're writing a parser for a programming language, and we want a data type to represent expressions.
Expressions can have different types, so we should use a generic `Expression` type.

```cs
inductive Expression<T>
{
	Expression<int> IntLiteral(int value),
	Expression<string> StringLiteral(string value),
	Expression<int> Add(Expression<int> a, Expression<int> b),
	Expression<string> ToString(Expression<int> value),
}
```

```hs
inductive Expression : (α : Type) → Type
| intLiteral (value : Int) : Expression Int
| stringLiteral (value : String) : Expression String
| add (a : Expression Int) (b : Expression Int) : Expression Int
| toString (value : Expression Int) : Expression String
```

--

We can write a function to evaluate an expression, using pattern matching:

```cs
T Eval<T>(Expression<T> expression)
{
	switch (expression)
	{
		case Expression.IntLiteral(int value):
			return value;
		case Expression.StringLiteral(string value):
			return value;
		case Expression.Add(Expression<int> a, Expression<int> b):
			return Eval(a) + Eval(b);
		case Expression.ToString(Expression<int> value):
			return Eval(value).ToString();
	}
}
```

```hs
def eval {α} : Expression α → α
| Expression.intLiteral value => value
| Expression.stringLiteral value => value
| Expression.add a b => eval a + eval b
| Expression.toString value => toString (eval value)
```

---

# Chapter 4: Dependent types

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

Just like generic types can take types as parameters, dependent types can take values as parameters.

A classic example is a vector, which is a list of a fixed length.
The length is part of the type itself, not just the object.

Perhaps C#'s syntax could be extended like this:

```cs
inductive Vector<Type T, Nat N>
{
	Vector<T, 0> Empty<T>(),
	Vector<T, N + 1> Add<T, N>(T head, Vector<T, N> tail),
}
```

In Lean, it looks like this:

```hs
inductive Vector (α : Type) : (n : Nat) → Type
| empty : Vector α 0
| add (head : α) (tail : Vector α n) : Vector α (n + 1)
```

--

If we try to assign a vector of the wrong length, we get a compile error:

```cs
Vector<int, 3> vector = Vector.Add(1, Vector.Add(2, Vector.Add(3, Vector.Empty())));
Vector<int, 37> longVector = vector; // Compile error
```

```hs
def vector : Vector Int 3 := Vector.add 1 (Vector.add 2 (Vector.add 3 Vector.empty))
def longVector : Vector Int 37 := vector -- Compile error
```

--

## Dependent functions

A dependent function is a function where the output type depends on the input value.

For example, we can write a function that initializes a vector with a default value and a length.

```cs
Vector<T, length> BlankVector<T>(T blankValue, Nat length)
{
	switch (length)
	{
		case Nat.Zero:
			return Vector.Empty();
		case Nat.OnePlus(int n):
			return Vector.Add(blankValue, BlankVector(blankValue, n));
	}
}
```

Notice that the output type depends on the input value `length`.

```hs
def blankVector {α : Type} (blankValue : α) : (length : Nat) → Vector α length
| 0 => Vector.empty
| n + 1 => Vector.add blankValue (blankVector blankValue n)
```

--

You could use such a function like this:

```cs
Vector<int, 3> vector = BlankVector(0, 3);
Vector<int, 3> longVector = BlankVector(0, 37); // Compile error
```

```hs
def vector : Vector Int 3 := blankVector 0 3
def longVector : Vector Int 3 := blankVector 0 37 -- Compile error
```

--

Now for that example from earlier.
The goal is to make a list indexer function where the range is enforced by the compiler.

The first step is to define a type that represents a finite range of numbers.
That is, a type `Fin<N>` where the only valid values are 0 through N - 1.

```cs
inductive Fin<Nat N>
{
	Fin<N + 1> Zero<N>(),
	Fin<N + 1> OnePlus<N>(Fin<N> value),
}
```

```hs
inductive Fin : Nat → Type
| zero {n} : Fin (n + 1)
| onePlus {n} (value : Fin n) : Fin (n + 1)
```

Interestingly, there's no way to create a `Fin<0>`. It's an empty type.

--

Now it's possible to restrict the index to less than the length of the list:

```cs
T Get<T>(List<T> list, Fin<list.Length> index)
{
	switch (list, index)
	{
		case List.Add(T head, List<T> _), Fin.Zero():
			return head;
		case List.Add(T _, List<T> tail), Fin.OnePlus(Fin<list.Length> i):
			return Get(tail, i);
	}
}
```

```hs
def get {α} : (list : List α) → Fin (list.length) → α
| List.add head _, Fin.zero => head
| List.add _ tail, Fin.onePlus i => get tail i
```

Note that in our pattern matching, we don't have to consider the case where the list is empty.
If the list was empty, `index` would be a `Fin<0>`, which has no possible cases.
Taken together, there is no combination of `list` and `index` where `list` is empty.

---

# Chapter 5: Propositions

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

Propositions are statements of fact that have a truth value. 1 + 1 = 2 is a true proposition, and 2 + 2 = 1 is a false proposition.
We can write propositions about our code that let us reason about its behaviour.

Propositions can be represented as types whose values are proofs.
A false proposition is a type with no valid values.

There isn't anything fundamentally different between propositions and other types.
The difference is mainly about the data being represented. Most types have values that represent some kind of data.
Proofs, on the other hand, don't carry data.
The only thing that matters to a proposition is whether some proof exists or not.

--

Let's create a proposition defining even numbers:

```cs
inductive Even<Nat N>
{
	Even<N * 2> Double<N>(),
}
```

```hs
inductive Even : Nat → Type
| double (n) : Even (n * 2)
```

Now if we have a value of type `Even<N>`, we know that `N` is even.
If it's odd, it would have been impossible to construct a proof.

--

Another proposition defines whether one number is less than or equal to another:

```cs
inductive LessEq<Nat A, Nat B>
{
	LessEq<A, A> Equal<A>(),
	LessEq<A, B + 1> Increment<A, B>(LessEq<A, B> proof),
}
```

```hs
inductive LessEq : Nat → Nat → Type
| equal (a) : LessEq a a
| increment {a b} (proof : LessEq a b) : LessEq a (b + 1)
```

--

Using `LessEq`, we can define what it means for a list to be sorted:

```cs
inductive Sorted<List<Nat> list>
{
	Sorted<List.Empty> Empty,
	Sorted<List.Add(a, List.Empty())> Single(Nat a),
	Sorted<List.Add(a, List.Add(b, tail))> Add(
		Nat a, Nat b, List<Nat> tail, LessEq<a, b> aLessEqB, Sorted<List.Add(b, tail)> tailSorted),
}
```

```hs
inductive Sorted : List Nat → Type
| empty : Sorted List.empty
| single (a) : Sorted (List.add a List.empty)
| add {a b tail} (aLessEqB : LessEq a b) (tailSorted : Sorted (List.add b tail))
  : Sorted (List.add a (List.add b tail))
```

--

At this point, the `BinarySearch` problem can be solved just by adding an extra argument to the function:

```cs
Nat BinarySearch(List<Nat> list, Nat value, Sorted<list> listSorted)
	...
```

```hs
def binarySearch : (list : List Nat) → Nat → Sorted list → Nat
	...
```

Now it's impossible to accidentally pass an unsorted list to `BinarySearch`,
because you'll get stuck trying to provide the last argument.

The body of the function doesn't need to change, because the algorithm is already correct.
It's just stricter about the inputs it accepts.

---

# Epilogue: So What?

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->

--

Stronger types are all about minimizing the number of ways to make mistakes.

Powerful type systems are used in practice to prove the correctness of important software,
such as you might find in a nuclear powerplant or commercial airliner.

I'm not trying to tell you that dependent types are the solution to all your problems.
I'm not even trying to tell you to learn a dependently typed language.
(OK that's a lie, you totally should.)

Adopting a "strong typing" attitude will help you write more robust code, and I hope this talk has inspired you to
strive for that.

Strong typing is your friend. Use it. Your compiler might not thank you, but your future self will.

--

If you want to learn more, here are some suggestions:

- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is a functional programming language with a powerful type system.
Although it also doesn't support dependent types, it's a huge step up in power from C# in terms of the type system.
- [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) is my favourite programming language.
It fully supports dependent types, and it's also used by many mathematicians to write formal proofs.

For an extra funky example of dependent types, check out Brian McKenna's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVBck2Zngjo)
on type-safe string formatting.
That is, what if you could write a version of `Console.WriteLine` that fails to compile if you miss an argument?
With dependent types, it's possible to control the entire argument list based on the format string!

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Processed {0} out of {1} items", count); // Compile error
```
